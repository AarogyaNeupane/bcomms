# Sentiment Analysis Implementation Task List

This document outlines the steps taken to implement the Rev.ai sentiment analysis feature in the speaking practice application.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Create Sentiment Analysis Service

- [x] Created `RevAiSentimentService` class in `src/lib/services/rev-ai-sentiment-service.ts`
- [x] Defined interfaces for sentiment analysis API responses
- [x] Implemented methods to submit text for analysis
- [x] Implemented methods to check job status
- [x] Implemented methods to retrieve sentiment results
- [x] Added utility method to calculate sentiment summary

### 2. Create API Routes for Sentiment Analysis

- [x] Created new API route at `src/app/api/sentiment/route.ts`
- [x] Implemented handler for submitting text for sentiment analysis
- [x] Implemented handler for checking job status
- [x] Implemented handler for retrieving sentiment results
- [x] Added proper error handling

### 3. Update Data Models

- [x] Extended `FeedbackResponse` interface in `src/lib/services/groq-service.ts` to include sentiment data
- [x] Created `SentimentSummary` interface to represent sentiment analysis results

### 4. Create UI Components for Sentiment Feedback

- [x] Created `SentimentFeedback` component in `src/components/ui/sentiment-feedback.tsx`
- [x] Implemented sentiment visualization with color-coded indicators
- [x] Added sentiment breakdown with positive/negative/neutral percentages
- [x] Added detailed view of individual sentiment messages

### 5. Integrate Sentiment Analysis into Workflow

- [x] Updated `FeedbackCard` component to display sentiment feedback
- [x] Modified `handleSubmitRecording` function in `page.tsx` to:
  - [x] Submit transcription for sentiment analysis in parallel with language feedback
  - [x] Show language feedback immediately when available
  - [x] Update UI with sentiment analysis when it completes
  - [x] Handle errors gracefully (sentiment analysis is optional)

### 6. Update API Status Checking

- [x] Added sentiment API status check in `checkApiAvailability` function
- [x] Updated API setup instructions to mention sentiment analysis

## How It Works

1. When a user records and submits their speech:
   - The transcription is sent to Groq for language feedback
   - In parallel, the same transcription is sent to Rev.ai for sentiment analysis

2. The language feedback is displayed immediately when available

3. When sentiment analysis completes (which may take longer), the UI is updated to include:
   - Overall sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral)
   - Sentiment score visualization
   - Breakdown of positive/negative/neutral statements
   - Detailed view of individual sentiment messages (optional)

4. If sentiment analysis fails for any reason, the application still shows language feedback without interruption

## Benefits

- Provides deeper insights into the emotional tone of the user's speech
- Helps users understand how their communication might be perceived emotionally
- Complements language feedback with sentiment context
- Non-blocking implementation ensures core functionality remains responsive

## Future Improvements

- Add caching for sentiment analysis results to improve performance
- Implement sentiment highlighting in the transcription text
- Add sentiment trends over time for returning users
- Enhance visualization with more detailed sentiment breakdowns
